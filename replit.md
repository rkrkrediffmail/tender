## Overview

This is an AI-Powered Tender Analysis & Proposal Generation System built with Flask and PostgreSQL. The system implements a multi-agent architecture where specialized AI agents collaborate to analyze tender documents, perform deep reasoning, and generate comprehensive proposals through coordinated intelligence. The application now features a complete database backend with 9 tables storing agent data, projects, documents, requirements, tasks, and communications.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask with Jinja2 templating
- **UI Framework**: Bootstrap 5 for responsive design
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JavaScript with Chart.js for data visualization
- **Icons**: Font Awesome for comprehensive iconography
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with CSS variables for theming

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask (Python web framework) with PostgreSQL database
- **Database**: 9-table schema with SQLAlchemy ORM for data persistence
- **Structure**: MVC architecture with database models, API endpoints, and template rendering
- **Session Management**: Flask sessions with configurable secret key
- **Data Storage**: Projects, agents, tasks, documents, requirements, communications
- **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints for real-time data updates

### Multi-Agent System Design
The application is designed around a sophisticated multi-agent architecture:
- **Agent Orchestrator**: Master AI that coordinates all specialized agents
- **Analysis Agents**: Document Intelligence, Requirements Analysis
- **Solution Agents**: Architecture Design, Technical Planning
- **Delivery Agents**: Project Management, Quality Assurance

## Key Components

### Core Application Structure
- **app.py**: Main Flask application with route definitions
- **main.py**: Application entry point
- **templates/**: HTML templates for all user interfaces
- **static/**: CSS and JavaScript assets

### User Interface Components
- **Dashboard**: Main overview with agent ecosystem monitoring
- **Document Upload**: File upload interface with drag-and-drop support
- **Agent Workflow**: Real-time visualization of agent collaboration
- **Agent Communication**: Inter-agent messaging display
- **Requirements Analysis**: AI-powered requirement extraction
- **Solution Architecture**: Technical architecture presentation
- **Project Planning**: Timeline and resource allocation views
- **Proposal Generation**: Document creation and synthesis interface

### Frontend Features
- Responsive design with Bootstrap 5
- Real-time updates and monitoring dashboards
- Interactive workflow visualizations
- Agent performance monitoring
- Quality assurance tracking
- Document management interface

## Data Flow

### Request Flow
1. User accesses application through Flask routes
2. Flask renders appropriate Jinja2 templates
3. Static assets (CSS/JS) enhance user experience
4. JavaScript handles client-side interactions and real-time updates

### Agent Coordination Flow
1. Document upload triggers document intelligence agent
2. Requirements analysis agent extracts and classifies requirements
3. Solution agents generate technical architecture
4. Project planning agent creates timelines
5. Quality assurance agent validates outputs
6. Proposal generation synthesizes all components

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **Bootstrap 5**: UI framework for responsive design
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library for visual elements
- **Chart.js**: Data visualization library for monitoring dashboards

### Backend Dependencies
- **Flask**: Core web framework
- **Jinja2**: Template engine (included with Flask)
- **Python standard library**: logging, os modules

### Missing Dependencies (To be added)
- Database system (recommended: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM)
- AI/ML libraries for agent implementation
- Real-time communication system (WebSockets)
- File processing libraries for document analysis
- Authentication and authorization system

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Setup
- Flask development server with debug logging
- Environment-based configuration
- Static file serving through Flask

### Production Considerations
- Environment variable configuration for secrets
- Secure session management
- Scalable file upload handling
- Database integration for persistent storage
- Real-time communication infrastructure
- Agent orchestration system implementation

### Architecture Decisions

**Problem**: Need for specialized AI agent coordination
**Solution**: Multi-agent architecture with role-based specialization
**Rationale**: Allows for domain expertise and parallel processing of complex tender analysis tasks

**Problem**: User interface for complex AI workflows
**Solution**: Bootstrap-based responsive web interface with real-time monitoring
**Rationale**: Provides professional appearance with minimal development overhead

**Problem**: Real-time monitoring of agent activities
**Solution**: JavaScript-based dashboards with live updates
**Rationale**: Enables users to track progress and intervene when necessary

**Problem**: Document processing and analysis workflow
**Solution**: Multi-stage pipeline with specialized agents
**Rationale**: Breaks down complex analysis into manageable, specialized tasks

### Future Enhancements
- Database integration for persistent data storage
- Authentication and user management
- WebSocket implementation for real-time updates
- AI model integration for actual agent functionality
- File processing capabilities for document analysis
- API endpoints for agent communication
- Deployment containerization with Docker
